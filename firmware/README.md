Moodlight Firmware for STM32x
=============================

This folder contains the Moodlight firmware for STM32x microcontrollers and the STM32x-discovery boards in particular.


Build by calling `make all` in the firmware folder.

The Makefile will download and compile the STM32 standard periphial library from ST as it can not be included into this source tree for liecensing reasons.
